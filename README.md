## Transit Near Me

Transit Near Me tries to help people learn about nearby transit services that they might not be aware of
in a simple and easy way. It visualizes them as an interactive "spider map" of direct services from your location.

Transit Near me is web application, and runs on desktop computers and mobile devices. It has been tested extensively on iPhone. 

The code is written in Python with a Javascript front end using Leaflet for map layers, and MapBox for map tiles. It uses schedule data from GTFS, along with real-time predictions from various real-time APIs including NextBus.
