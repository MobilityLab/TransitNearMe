## Introduction

Transit Near Me tries to help people learn about nearby transit services that they might not be aware of
in a simple and easy way. It visualizes them as an interactive "spider map" of direct services from your location. 

To see a running installation (greater Washington, DC services only) visit http://dev.mobilitylab.org/TransitNearMe.

Transit Near me is a web application, and runs on desktop computers and mobile devices. It has been tested extensively on iPhone. 

## Instructions

The code is written in Python using Django.
The front end is Javascript with Leaflet for map layers, and MapBox for map tiles. 
Schedule data comes from GTFS, along with real-time predictions from various real-time APIs including NextBus and Connexionz.
